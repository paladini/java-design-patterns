## Java Design Patterns ##

I've implemented some of the most common design patterns based on [Tutorials Point articles](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/index.htm) about Design Patterns in Java.

The following design patterns were implemented:

- Adapter - OK
- Factory - OK
- Abstract Factory - 
- Strategy - OK
- Composite - OK
- Singleton - OK
- Facade - 
- Observer - 
- Builder - OK
- Decorator - 
- State - OK
- Template - OK
- Command 
- Object Null 
- Iterator 

You can also find the Diagram Class (UML) of the desired design pattern inside the folder of each design pattern source.
